# TiOF2 2x2x2 configurations

This directory contains a script `2x2x2_configs.py` that generates all symmetry inequivalent 2&times;2&times;2 supercells of pseudo-rocksalt TiOF<sub>2</sub>.

The script first constructs a ReO<sub>3</sub> structured supercell as a `pymatgen` `Structure`, then uses `bsym` [[1]] to identify all symmetry inequivalent configurations in the 2&times;2&times;2 supercell. Each configuration is saved as a `VASP` `POSCAR` with filename `config_<id>.poscar`, where `<id>` is the configuration number as generated by `bsym.`

## Requirements
The following Python modules are required.
- numpy
- bsym
- pymatgen
These can be installed with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
```
./2x2x2_configs.py
```

## Inputs
None

## Outputs
A set of 2664 `VASP` `POSCAR` files, in the `poscars` subdirectory. Each `POSCAR` is named and labelled with its configuration numbers.
