title: TiOF2 4x4x4 config 5
description: Full geometry optimisation of a 4x4x4 supercell of TiOF2
notes: This structure was generated using a genetic algorithm optimisation with the MAPS cluster expansion (2x2x2 configurations only). The CE predicted energy is -1707.89888  eV. The MAPS str.out structure corresponding to the starting POSCAR is `opt_str.out`.
