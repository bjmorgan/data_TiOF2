title: TiOF2 4x4x4 config 1 cubic
description: Cell-constrained geometry optimisation of a 4x4x4 supercell of TiOF2
notes: This structure was generated using a genetic algorithm optimisation with the MAPS cluster expansion (2x2x2 configurations only). The CE predicted energy is -1708.18048 eV. The MAPS str.out structure corresponding to the starting POSCAR is `opt_str.out`. This optimisation is performed in a cubic cell, with the volume fixed to that of a full geometry optimisation.
